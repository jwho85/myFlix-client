# myFlix-client

## Description

The objective of this project was to build the client-side for an application called myFlix based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database) using React. It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Axios, React Bootstrap, and React Router.

## Tech

<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>Axios</li>
<li>React Bootstrap</li>
<li>React Router</li>
</ul>

## The 5 Ws

1. Who—The  users  of  your  myFlix  application.  They  will  be  movie  enthusiasts  who  enjoy  reading  information  about  different  movies.  
2. What—A  single-page,  responsive  application  with  routing,  rich  interactions,  several  interface  views,  and  a  polished  user  experience.  The  client-side  developed  in  this  Achievement  will  support  the  existing  server-side  from  Achievement  2   by  facilitating  user  requests  and  rendering  the  response  from  the  server-side  via  a  number  of  different  interface  views.  
3. When—myFlix  users  will  be  able  to  use  it  whenever  they  want  to  read  information  about  different  movies  or  update  their  user  information—for  instance,  their  list  of  “Favorite  Movies.”  Page  1   
4. Where—The  application  will  be  hosted  online.  The  myFlix  application  itself  is  responsive  and  can  therefore  be  used  anywhere  and  on  any  device,  giving  all  users  the  same  experience.  
5. Why—Movie  enthusiasts  like  to  be  able  to  access  information  about  different  movies,  directors,  and  genres,  whenever  they  want  to.  Having  the  ability  to  save  lists  of  favorite  movies  will  ensure  users  always  have  access  to  the  films  they  want  to  watch  or  recommend  to  their  peers.
